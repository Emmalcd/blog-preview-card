## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through these challenges I have to practicing markdown and some css features to make responsive designs like this one.
In addition to practicing my English

```css
.card {
  background-color: var(--white);
  border: 1px solid var(--darkGray);
  /* The next line help me to make a responsive design */
  width: min(380px, 90%);
  border-radius: 15px;
  padding: 20px;
  -webkit-box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 0px var(--darkGray);
  -moz-box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 0px var(--darkGray);
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 0px var(--darkGray);
}
```

### Continued development

I hope the following challenges will increase in complexity and help me continue practicing.

### Useful resources
